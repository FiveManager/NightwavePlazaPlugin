Sorry if this plugin is bad I have no idea how to use html.

## Usage

1. Click on the green `Use this template` button to create a new repository for your plugin
2. Rename the `plugin_template.py` file to something unique
3. Add your code to the plugin's python and html files.
4. To use it, simply `git clone` the repo into the `/home/deck/homebrew/plugins` folder on your Steam Deck
